- Meaningful Naming: Use descriptive names for methods and variables to enhance code readability. For example, create_list_of_website_links() over links() and use for element in web_element_list instead of for i in list

- Eliminate Code Duplication: Identify repeated code blocks and refactor them into separate methods or functions. This promotes code reusability and reduces the likelihood of bugs
