## Project description
This is a simple python scrpit that plays a game of hangman with the user.

- ### Project aim

The aim of this project was to use what I've learnt so far in this course to create a hangman game.

- ### What it does
When run, the game will ask the user to guess a letter. It will then show if the letter is in the word or not, taking a life away if not. The game will repeat this process until the user has guessed the word or ran out of lives.

## Installation instructions
Before you start, ensure that you have the following installed on your system:

1. Make sure you have Python installed on your computer first. Download it from [Here](https://www.python.org/downloads/) if you don't have it already!

2. To install simply **clone** the the repository from github by running: **git clone https://github.com/CF-Hyett/Hangman.git** in your command line 

3. Run the python scrpit **milstone_5.py** . in your command line run: **python milestone_5.py** 


4. You should now be good to go!

## Usage instructions
Playing the game is simple. After running the scrpit as previously mentioned in [**installation instructions**](#installation-instructions), follow the on-screen prompts in the terminal.

Have fun!
